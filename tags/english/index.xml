May be requested in batches
Additional requirements (fault domain)
Potential for sudden bursts (diversity of tenant requests)
Current research status of VM sequence generation VM sequence generation is a key root technology that affects many key downstream businesses such as simulation platforms and capacity expansion recommendations. Some current research methods mainly include LSTM-based timing learning methods, Bootstrap-based historical real sequence resampling methods, and clustering-based resampling methods.</description></item><item><title>A lightweight and explainable data driven scheme for fault detection of aerospace sensors</title><link>https://zhongzhili.github.io/en/2023/12/20/first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhongzhili.github.io/en/2023/12/20/first-post/</guid><description>Article link if you are interested.
Motivation Aerospace sensors measure the aircraft states including airspeed, attitude angles, load factors, etc. In literature many flight accidents were caused by aerospace sensors fault. It is imminent to develop fault detection and classification (FDC) techniques for the aerospace sensors.
Currently, there are 3 main types of research on this problem. The first is rule-based methods, and the second is model-based detection methods.</description></item><item><title>Request prediction of virtual machine resources (references paper)</title><link>https://zhongzhili.github.io/en/2023/12/18/first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhongzhili.github.io/en/2023/12/18/first-post/</guid><description>Article link if you are interested.
