Motivation Aerospace sensors measure the aircraft states including airspeed, attitude angles, load factors, etc. In literature many flight accidents were caused by aerospace sensors fault. It is imminent to develop fault detection and classification (FDC) techniques for the aerospace sensors.
Currently, there are 3 main types of research on this problem. The first is rule-based methods, and the second is model-based detection methods.</description></item><item><title>Request prediction of virtual machine resources (references paper)</title><link>https://zhongzhili.github.io/en/2023/12/18/first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhongzhili.github.io/en/2023/12/18/first-post/</guid><description>Article link if you are interested.
