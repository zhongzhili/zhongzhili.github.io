这是李忠智的个人主页。我目前在复旦大学攻读硕士学位，研究方向是机器学习与算法设计。12至今，我已在SCI期刊上发表8篇论文，在EI期刊上发表1篇论文，在北大中文核心期刊上发表3篇论文，其中以第一作者身份共发表10篇论文，发表论文总被引用数达到超过400（[H-index为11](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Ij0LvhkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&citft=1&email_for_op=zzli22%40m.fudan.edu.cn&gmla=AP6z3OZpFQC3SIFgj54p15jMFOdCTABvY-YSv2TNR-_69_4fS0vi37uPMdGts1zlP2gnAWb_kDZ19lvNwMa0aHlRI5s)）。除了独立研究，我还热衷于服务学术界的发展，多次受邀担任IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence，IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics及IEEE Internet of Things Journal等各大顶级学术期刊的审稿人，曾荣获2021年《沈阳市自然科学学术成果》优秀奖等诸多荣誉。此外，我在工业界也不断积累实践经验，曾在东莞证券（上海分公司）担任量化实习生、在国轩高科（上海国际研发总部）大数据工程部门担任算法实习生以及在[华为算法创新Lab](https://www.huaweicloud.com/lab/algorithm/about.html)担任机器学习算法实习生。

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is Li Zhongzhi's personal homepage. I am currently studying for a master's degree at Fudan University. My research interests are ML and Algorithm Design. I have published 8 papers in SCI journals, 1 paper in EI journals, and 3 papers in Peking University Chinese core journals. Among them, I have published 10 papers as the first author. The number of citations reaches more than 400 (H-index is 11). In addition to independent research, I have been invited to serve as the reviewer for many academic journals such as IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics and IEEE Internet of Things Journal. I have won the Excellence Award of the 2021 Shenyang Natural Science Academic Achievements and many other honors. In addition, I have also continued to accumulate practical experience in the industry. I have served as a quantitative intern at Dongguan Securities (Shanghai Branch), an algorithm intern at the big data engineering department of Guoxuan Hi-Tech (Shanghai International R&D Headquarters), and a machine learning algorithm intern at Huawei Algorithm Innovation Lab.</p>
