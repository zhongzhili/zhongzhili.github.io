这是李忠智的个人主页。我目前在复旦大学攻读硕士学位，研究方向是时序数据预测、信号处理与迁移学习。至今，我已在SCI期刊上发表7篇论文，在EI期刊上发表1篇论文，在北大中文核心期刊上发表3篇论文，其中以第一作者身份共发表6篇论文，发表论文总被引用数达到280次（H-index为8）。除了独立研究，我还多次受邀担任《IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence》等各大学术期刊的审稿人，曾荣获2021年《沈阳市自然科学学术成果》优秀奖等诸多荣誉。此外，我在工业界也不断积累实践经验，曾在东莞证券（上海分公司）担任量化实习生、在国轩高科（上海国际研发总部）大数据工程部门担任算法实习生以及在[华为算法创新Lab](https://www.huaweicloud.com/lab/algorithm/about.html)担任机器学习算法实习生。

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is Li Zhongzhi’s personal homepage. I am currently studying for a master's degree at Fudan University. My research interests are time series data prediction, signal processing and transfer learning. So far, I have published 7 papers in SCI journals, 1 paper in EI journals, and 3 papers in Peking University Chinese core journals. Among them, I have published 6 papers as the first author, and my published papers have always been cited. The number reaches 280 times (H-index is 8). In addition to independent research, I have been invited to serve as a reviewer for major academic journals such as "IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence" many times. I have won the 2021 "Shenyang Natural Science Academic Achievements" Excellence Award and many other honors. In addition, I have also continued to accumulate practical experience in the industry. I have served as a quantitative intern at Dongguan Securities (Shanghai Branch), an algorithm intern at the big data engineering department of Guoxuan Hi-Tech (Shanghai International R&D Headquarters), and [Huawei Algorithm Innovation Lab](https://www.huaweicloud.com/lab/algorithm/about.html) serves as a machine learning algorithm intern.</p>
