<p style="text-align: justify;">This is Li Zhongzhi’s personal homepage. I am currently studying for a master's degree at Fudan University. My research interests are signal processing, transfer learning and prediction of time series data. So far, I have published 7 papers in SCI journals, 1 paper in EI journals, and 3 papers in Peking University Chinese core journals. Among them, I have published 6 papers as the first author. The number of citations reaches 293 (H-index is 9). In addition to independent research, I have been invited to serve as the reviewer for many academic journals such as "IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence". I have won the 2021 "Shenyang Natural Science Academic Achievements" Excellence Award and many other honors. In addition, I have also continued to accumulate practical experience in the industry.</p>
